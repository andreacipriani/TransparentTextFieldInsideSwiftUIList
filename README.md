# TransparentTextFieldInsideSwiftUIList
This repo reproduces a macOS SwiftUI issue where a TextField inside a List doesn't keep a transparent background while editing.

The desired behaviour is to have a textfield with a clear background, but as you can notice from the screenshots, when the textfield is placed inside a List, the background isn't clear.
